<h2 class="nocount" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>MASAR (MAchine Snapshot, Archiving, and Retrieve) is a service which
is implemented under EPICS V4 framework. It consists of both server and
client that are implemented in C++/Python. The server part is responsible to
take machine snapshot, archives data in relational database, and
retrieves data back to client. The client part provides a default GUI to retrieve
data, compares data with live machine, and restores machine with given snapshot
data. A Python interface for scripting user.
</p>

<h2 class="nocount" id="status">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>This is the 05-Mar-2012 version of the MASAR User Manual. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>MASAR is implemented in C++/Python, which is using EPICS V4 channelRPC
mechanism for network communication. Current implementation is using SQLite3 as
underneath relational database, and a Python module so-called PYMASAR is developed to access
SQLite3. 
</p>
<p>
Since EPICS V4 channelRPC server is implemented in C++, interface between V4 processing and PYMASAR
is implemented using Python/C. A Python API is provided for client user, and a default PyQt4 GUI is 
developed for end user.</p>

<p>For now the only way to obtain the MASAR service is from the
sourceforge mercurial repository. No binary package is provided at
current stage. Same as all EPICS V4 modules, MASAR service can be checked out 
from its mercurial repository on source forge. If there is an error such as
<pre>abort: error: Connection refused
</pre>
during checking out, it probably means that you have some problems with your network setting, 
for example http proxy setting. You can try to set your http_proxy environment, for example, 
on BASH shell:
<pre>
export http_proxy=http://your.proxy.server.name:port
</pre>
</p>

<p>
A quick reference is as below for how to compile and use MASAR:

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>System Requirement</h2>
<p>
To run MASAR on you machine, you need some modules including EPICS V3 and V4 run-time library and Python for both client and server.
</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
For MASAR server, you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SQLite3 3.7 or above</li>
</ul>
<p>For MASAR client default GUI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PyQt4 4.8 or above</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, MASAR has been installed on the following systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Debian 7.0 (Wheezy)</li>
  <li>Fedora 14</li>
  <li>Fedora 16</li>
  <li>Mac OS-X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
Addition to the term used by EPICS community, MASAR defines some new terms for its convenience as below:
<ul>
  <li>pv group: a collection of pv name, which has name, pv list, description, and date;</li>
  <li>service config: a unique config, which has name, pv/pv group list, description, and which system it belongs to;</li>
  <li>system: identify which sub system of each configuration belongs to;</li>
  <li>service event: description of each particular snapshot, including comment, author name, date, and status;</li>
  <li>snapshot: real data of each snapshot event.</li>
  <li>interface name convention</li>
  <ul>
    <li>putXXXX(): put into a live machine, more specifically, an EPICS live pv</li>
    <li>getXXXX(): get from a live machine, more specifically, an EPICS live pv</li>
    <li>saveXXX(): save into a RDB</li>
    <li>retrieveXXX(): retrieve from a RDB</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<h3>
Schematic
</h3>
The MASAR consists of client and server part, which is as below:
</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="masar/masar.png" width="480" height="360"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center">MASAR Architecture</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
The client has a client API library in Python, which can be used by both Python scripting, and GUI. A default PyQt4 GUI is
developed for data viewing, snapshot taking, comparing a snapshot with live machine, and restoring machine to a particular
status using a snapshot.
</p>
<p>
The server has 4 layers:
<ul>
  <li>Service communication control: the pvAccess channel RPC instance;</li>
  <li>Service: parse the command from client, and determine response action;</li>
  <li>Channel Access Client: this is bidirectional access to IOC, which is read data from IOC only;</li>
  <li>DSL (data source layer): this is a interface with Python domain, which is the same level with Channel Access Client.</li>
  <ul>
      <li>PYMASAR: A Python module to access SQLite3 database, which is supported by default currently;</li>
      <li>PYIRMIS: A Python module to access IRMIS/MySQL database, which is going to be supported.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Data layer.</li>
  <ul>
      <li>IOC: live machine data;</li>
      <li>IRMIS: static data, which can have all machine configuration.</li>
      <li>MASAR: embedded inside PYMASAR, which is dedicated to MASAR service.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>
SQLite3 Schema
</h3>
Currently, SQLite3 is the first database supported by MASAR service. Its original schema is inherited from IRMIS,
and now is as below:
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="masar/masar-sqlite-eer.png" width="480" height="360"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center">MASAR SQLite3 Schema</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>
IRMIS Schema
</h3>
Principally, with the support of Python database access, switching between different relational database will be seamless.
To minimize the effort when switching from SQLite to IRMIS, we try to keep the schema
same with SQLite3 as much as possible.
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="masar/masar-eer.png" width="480" height="480"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center">MASAR IRMIS Schema</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>MASAR Server</h2>
The MASAR server can take a snapshot for any combination of EPICS pv, including scalar pv with string, 
enum, byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (which is same with integer in EPICS V3), float,
and double, and/or waveform/array pv with any above types. Since the data types supported by both Python
and SQLite3/IRMIS are string, int, and real, the types are casted as below:
<pre>
enum, string -> string
byte, short, int/long -> long
float, double -> double
</pre>
For waveform data, it is serialized into a binary format, and stored as a BLOB. At current stage, the BLOB
is one field of masar_data table, and might be saved in a separated table if there is any performance issue.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: 
<ol>
<li>All time inside database uses UTC/POSIX time, which means the IOC time, seconds past EPOCH has
been shifted to POSIX time already.</li>
<li>All timestamps in service_event, service_config, and pv_group tables are the time when inserting data into database.
This means that the time stamp for a particular snapshot is exact the time when the data is inserted into database.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>
Functions
</h3>
<p>
The MASAR supports 6 fundamental functions to access SQLite3/IRMIS:
<ul>
  <li><b>retrieveServiceConfigProps</b>: get a list from RDB that how many sub-systems are defined;</li>
  <li><b>retrieveServiceConfigs</b>: get a list of configurations with given conditions;</li>
  <li><b>retrieveServiceEvents</b>: get a list how many snapshot events have been taken with given conditions;</li>
  <li><b>retrieveSnapshot</b>: get real snapshot data;</li>
  <li><b>saveSnapshot</b>: save a snapshot into database;</li>
  <li><b>updateSnapshotEvent</b>: update a particular snapshot, for example flag a snapshot as approved;</li>
</ul>
As shown above, the compare and restore functions, which are implemented in the client side, are not part of server. 
</p>
<h3>
Data format
</h3>
<p>
When a MASAR request is sent from client to server, NTNameValue type is used to carry 
parameters, which is as below:
<pre>
structure NTNameValue
   string[]    names
   string[]    values
   string      function xxxxxx // function name as above
</pre>

The name/value pair is converted into a Python dictionary inside service layer, and transferred to PYMASAR/PYIRMIS layer.
Acceptable names for above 6 functions are listed as below:
<pre>
retrieveServiceConfigProps:
        names = ["propname", "servicename", "configname"]
retrieveServiceConfigs:
        names = ["servicename", "configname", "system"]
retrieveServiceEvents:
        names = ["configid", "start", "end", "comment", "user"]
retrieveSnapshot: 
        names = ["eventid", "start", "end", "comment"]
saveSnapshot:
        names = ["servicename","configname","comment"]
updateSnapshotEvent:
        names = ["eventid", "user", "desc"]
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The results from server are carried using a NTTable as below:
<pre>
structure NTTable
    structure timeStamp
        long secondsPastEpoch 0
        int nanoSeconds 0
        int userTag 0
    structure alarm
        int severity 0
        int status 0
        string message 
    string[] label [...]
    ... // value field 
</pre>
</p>

<h3>
Database configuration
</h3>
For NSLS II, a default pv_group, which is a collection of pv names, will be configured in advance. User can either use the default pv_group configuration, or, with administrative privilege, create a new configuration. If a client wants to combine pv_groups, it creates, again with administrative privilege/authorization, a new configuration. Each configuration has a name, description, and created time. One configuration might have more than one snapshot event associated with it where the snapshots are taken separately at different times.
